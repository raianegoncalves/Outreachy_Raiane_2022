Description:  "Research data sources for carbon sequestration in forests"

Seeking to reduce the greenhouse effect, the Kyoto Conference, in 1997, enshrined the concept of carbon sequestration, with the aim of containing and reversing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. The most common form of carbon sequestration is carried out naturally by forests. In the growth phase, trees require a very large amount of carbon to develop, fixing CO2 from the atmosphere in the form of carbohydrates through photosynthesis, which are finally incorporated into the cell wall of the trees.
