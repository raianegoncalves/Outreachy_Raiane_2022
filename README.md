 Description about "Research data sources for carbon sequestration in forests"
```
   Seeking to reduce the greenhouse effect, the Kyoto Conference, in 1997, enshrined the concept of carbon sequestration, with the aim of containing and reversing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. The most common form of carbon sequestration is carried out naturally by forests. In the growth phase, trees require a very large amount of carbon to develop, fixing CO2 from the atmosphere in the form of carbohydrates through photosynthesis, which are finally incorporated into the cell wall of the trees.

  ## My mission and our mission
    
Preserving the environment is fundamental, after all, it contains the natural resources necessary for our survival, such as water, food and raw materials. Without these resources, all life on the planet could end. You are aware that your actions, no matter how small, can have a big impact on the planet, you know?
    I choose this project because I know that my small everyday actions help to "preserve" the environment. And choosing this project, it's just one more action for that.
We can contribute in different ways, such as:

- Do not throw garbage in the street;
- Separate the trash;
- Take care of our water resources;
- Use less plastic;
- Save energy;
- Etc.
    
    
  ## World

    Greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, trapping the sun's heat. This leads to global warming and climate change. The world is now warming faster than at any other time in recorded history and the causes are: The generation of electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels is responsible for a good share of global emissions.
    Most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, powerful greenhouse gases that coat the planet and trap the sun's heat. Worldwide, only about a quarter of electricity is generated by wind, sun and other renewable resources that, unlike fossil fuels, emit little or no greenhouse gases or air pollutants. With rising temperatures over time it is changing weather patterns and upsetting the balance of nature. This poses many risks to humans and all other life on earth, such as:
- Higher temperatures;
- An increasingly warmer and larger ocean;
- There will not be enough food;
- Poverty and displacement.
  
  ## Brazil
    
  Brazil is a country with a tropical climate and has 4 seasons represented by high rainfall, very hot, very cold and dry. And with the greenhouse effect, Brazil is already feeling these effects, especially in some regions, such as:

    * Southeast Brazil suffers from successive torrential rains;
    * In Minas Gerais, more than 100 cities were on alert. In the capital Belo Horizonte alone, it rained 935.2 millimeters in January, a historic record for the month according to the National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) and more than half the annual average;
    * Higher frequency of extreme weather events: droughts are longer and more intense, as are rainy seasons.

   In Brazil, the alteration of the hydrological cycle is already happening now. If greenhouse gas emissions and, consequently, the global average temperature continue to rise, ‚Äúthe North and Northeast regions and part of the Center-West will experience a reduction in rainfall, with periods of predominantly longer droughts, but perhaps without the compensation of raining more in the rainy season‚Äù, projects Nobre. ‚ÄúIn the South and Southeast, the tendency of the biomes represented there is that more extreme and lasting droughts also occur, interspersed with very rainy periods.
